{"bike":{"frame_model":"Citizen 2 Step-Thru","manufacturer":"Jamis","year":2012,"description":"The Citizen, one of our perennial favorites, a bike that squarely splits the difference between comfort and practicality, was re-designed for 2011 and the response was resoundingly all thumbs up. NNEEWW Taking some styling cues from the smooth, sexy lines of the Hudson, we gave the Citizen a sleekly arcing top tube for the Men\u2019s frames, with the women\u2019s frames receiving double S-bend tubes for a swoopy step-through frame that\u2019s easy to hop aboard, and preserves the Citizen\u2019s reputation for being well-mannered and easy to handle. NNEEWW Citizens were born-and-bred 25 years ago as street bikes and they remain so today.","original_msrp":"450.00","stock_photo_url":"https://bikebook.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/Fr/10269/12_citizen2l_bl.jpg","stock_photo_small":"https://bikebook.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/Fr/10269/medium_12_citizen2l_bl.jpg"},"components":[]}
