The frame & fork are fully heat-treated, & the frame is engineered with a double- butted top tube & downtube, sealed integrated headset, cut-out seat tube for large tire clearance, mid-BB, and 14mm rear axle slots. It also comes equipped with adapters for 3/8\u00e2\u20ac\u009d axles. The geometry is exactly what fixed gear freestyle riders are looking for: long top tube & low stand-over.
