{"bike":{"frame_model":"The Goblin (Signature Series)","manufacturer":"Heritage","year":2014,"description":"I really took inspiration from the Schwinn's of the 50's and 60's. Timeless, clean design is what you'll see. This frame will look relevant in 30 years. It's not a trend driven frame. The upright geometry allows for the feet to be placed flat on the ground. The geometry allows the rider to look straight ahead without bending the neck. The chain guard lettering is done by hand. I want to keep the lost art of hand lettering alive! Every chain guard will be different as we feel most new chain guards to be flimsy, boring and not representative of the Goblins price point.
