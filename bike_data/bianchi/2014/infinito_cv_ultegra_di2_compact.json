{"bike":{"frame_model":"Infinito CV Ultegra Di2 Compact","manufacturer":"Bianchi","year":2014,"description":"The Infinito was designed for the rider who wants to mix it up on Saturday's fast tempo group ride yet still remain comfortable logging a century on Sunday. The all-new Infinito CV has expanded its appeal to Pro Tour, Spring Classics racers and the most discerning performance enthusiasts thanks to its exclusive use of Countervail technology. Countervail was developed by a US aerospace company to incorporate viscoelastic, vibration cancelling properties into the carbon fiber layup process. Bianchi\u2019s proprietary use of this material dramatically reduces road vibration - maximizing ride control, increasing rigidity and peak power output, and diminishing rider fatigue over long distances. In addition to Countervail, rider comfort is enhanced by a slightly taller and more relaxed head tube paired with slightly longer chain stays. Steady cornering, quick acceleration, and stable descending - hallmarks of Bianchi racing geometry - are not compromised to achieve a smoother ride. The Infinito CV redesign adds new aero tubing, a tapered head tube, Pressfit 30 bottom bracket, and UTSS-inspired BAT seat stays to its tried and true performance endurance platform. Infinito literally means \"never ending.\" The number of miles you\u2019ll enjoy aboard an Infinito CV is never ending!
