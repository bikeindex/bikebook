{"bike":{"frame_model":"Semplice 2 SP Dama","manufacturer":"Bianchi","year":2014,"description":"In Italian, semplice means simple. The Semplice is cycling in its simplest form; sitting, steering, and pedaling. Just hop on the saddle, spin the pedals, and the SRAM 2-speed Automatix hub will do the shifting for you. There are no shifters, cables, or derailleurs to fuss with. When pedaling becomes too easy and your legs start to spin too fast, the Automatix hub smoothly shifts into second gear, propelling you farther and faster for the same effort. When you slow down or stop, Automatix returns you to first gear. Shifting isn\u2019t the only thing that makes the Semplice simple. Its lightweight aluminum Turismo frame and sporty ride position make maneuvering the city streets and local paths fast, easy, and comfortable. Its 28c tires are wide enough to tackle back alleys and rail trails yet thin enough to keep you zipping along on smoother surfaces. Add fenders, a rack, and lighting and you have a simple way to tackle every day.
